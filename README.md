# itinerary

This is a "microservice" application intended to be part of a microservice architecture.

It was built to create a service that given an origin city will return a list of itineraries.

This application is configured for Service Discovery and Configuration with Consul. On launch, it will refuse to start if it is not able to connect to Consul at [http://localhost:8500](http://localhost:8500). For more information, read our documentation on [Service Discovery and Configuration with Consul][].

## Development

To start your application in the dev profile, simply run:

    ./gradlew

## Building for production

### Packaging as jar

To build the final jar and optimize the itinerary application for production, run:

    ./gradlew -Pprod clean bootJar

To ensure everything worked, run:

    java -jar build/libs/*.jar

### Packaging as war

To package your application as a war in order to deploy it to an application server, run:

    ./gradlew -Pprod -Pwar clean bootWar

## Testing

To launch your application's tests, run:

    ./gradlew test integrationTest jacocoTestReport

For more information, refer to the [Running tests page][].

### Code quality

Sonar is used to analyse code quality. You can start a local Sonar server (accessible on http://localhost:9001) with:

```
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/sonar.yml up -d
```

You can run a Sonar analysis with using the [sonar-scanner](https://docs.sonarqube.org/display/SCAN/Analyzing+with+SonarQube+Scanner) or by using the gradle plugin.

Then, run a Sonar analysis:

```
./gradlew -Pprod clean check jacocoTestReport sonarqube
```

For more information, refer to the [Code quality page][].

## Using Docker to simplify development (optional)

A number of docker-compose configuration are available in the [src/main/docker](src/main/docker) folder to launch required third party services.

For example, to start a mariadb database in a docker container, run:

    docker-compose -f src/main/docker/mariadb.yml up -d

To stop it and remove the container, run:

    docker-compose -f src/main/docker/mariadb.yml down

You can also fully dockerize your application and all the services that it depends on.
To achieve this, first build a docker image of your app by running:

    ./gradlew bootJar -Pprod jibDockerBuild

Then run:

    docker-compose -f src/main/docker/app.yml up -d
